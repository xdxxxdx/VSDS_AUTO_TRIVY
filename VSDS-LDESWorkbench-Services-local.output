Dockerfile (dockerfile)
=======================
Tests: 16 (SUCCESSES: 15, FAILURES: 1, EXCEPTIONS: 0)
Failures: 1 (HIGH: 1, CRITICAL: 0)

HIGH: Specify at least 1 USER command in Dockerfile with non-root user as argument
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Running containers with 'root' user can lead to a container escape situation. It is a best practice to run containers as non-root users, which can be done by adding a 'USER' statement to the Dockerfile.
